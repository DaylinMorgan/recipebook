notes: #extra info about the recipe --- must be a list!
  - Since the recipe calls for so much butter and so little flour, it is vital that the batter is beaten vigorously enough so that it emulsifies. Otherwise, you risk the fat seeping out when baking in the oven. Just after adding the flour, you should be beating for about 40 strokes until the batter becomes very thick and begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl.
