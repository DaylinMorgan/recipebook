ingredients:
- 1/2 lb of bacon (cut into 1/2 inch squares)
- 2 lbs of ground beef
- 1 lb of ground pork (uncase sausages if ground pork is not available)
- 3-5 large peppers (typically green and red) (cut into 1 inch pieces)
- 1 large or 2 medium sweet onions (chopped, but not super small)
- 2-3 shallots (chopped)
- 5 cloves of garlic (finely chopped)
- 1 large can of peeled tomatoes (cut up into relatively small pieces)
- 1 or more jalapeno chilis (finely chopped)
- 1/2 cup of brown sugar
- 2 normal size containers of McCormick Chili powder
- 1 tbs of cumin or more if you wish
- 1 tbs of paprika
- some molasses
- beer (any kind, probably not light beer)
directions:
- In a heavy pot, brown the bacon over med/high heat
- Remove the bacon when brown to an a second pot, but keep the drippings in the heavy pot
- Brown the beef and pork in the heavy pot, when complete remove to the bacon pot, leave the drippings
- Add the peppers, onion, shallots, jalapeno to the heavy pot and saute/brown over medium heat until soft 
- "Once the items in #4 are starting to get soft, add the garlic and cook until #4 is complete (don't let the garlic burn)"
- Add the meat and bacon back into the heavy pot
- Add the tomatoes (and juice from can), one full container of Chili powder, cumin, paprika and mix well (add up to 2 teaspoons of salt)
- Add enough beer to cover mixture
- Bring to a boil and then cut back to a simmer
- Simmer a few hours, if liquid level gets low, add more beer
- After two hours, stir in the brown sugar and 1/2 the second bottle of chili powder
- After another hour taste, if it needs more chili taste add more chili powder.  If it needs more sweetness add molasses. Salt if needed.
- Keep simmering and watching liquid level, adding beer as needed
- If you want more of a kick, add more jalapeno, but be careful, we have had issues with things getting overly seasoned
- Keep skimming off the grease that floats to the top of the pot
- After four hours or so, stop adding beer so the liquid evaporates and you get to the texture you are looking for
- At this point, remove from heat, cover and let it sit as long as you can.  The 2nd day is always better than the first
