ingredients:
- 5 slices bacon, diced
- 3 tablespoons (reserved) bacon grease or butter
- 1 white or yellow onion
- 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
- 1/4 cup all-purpose flour
- 2 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock
- 2 cups milk, warmed
- 1.5 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, diced
- 1 cup shredded sharp cheddar cheese
- 1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt or sour cream
- 1 teaspoon sea salt, or more to taste
- 1/2 teaspoon freshly-cracked black pepper
- "optional toppings: thinly-sliced green onions or chives, extra shredded cheese, extra bacon, sour cream"

directions:
- Heat a large stockpot over medium-high heat.  Add diced bacon and cook until crispy, stirring occasionally.
- Transfer the bacon to a separate plate, using a slotted spoon, reserving about 3 tablespoons of bacon grease in the stockpot
  (Or you can substitute butter in place of the 3 tablespoons of bacon grease).
- Add onion and sauté for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until soft.
- Stir in the garlic and sauté for an extra 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until fragrant.
- Stir the flour into the mixture and sauté for an additional 1 minute to cook the flour, stirring occasionally.
- Then stir in the stock until combined, followed by the milk and potatoes.
- Continue cooking until the mixture just reaches a simmer, before it begins to boil.
  Then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer for about 10-15 minutes or until the potatoes are soft, 
  being sure to stir the soup every few minutes so that the bottom does not burn.
- Once the potatoes are nice and soft, stir in the cheddar cheese and Greek yogurt (or sour cream), salt, pepper and cooked bacon bits.
- Taste and season with extra salt and pepper, if needed.
- Serve warm, garnished with desired toppings.  Or, transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate for up to 3 days.

notes: #extra info about the recipe --- must be a list!
  - Very tasty and reheats well, I recommend doubling if there are cold days ahead.
