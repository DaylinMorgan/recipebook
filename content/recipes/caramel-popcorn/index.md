notes:
  - butter can be substituted for margarine but may make the popcorn more greasy
  - if caramel is not well mixed while it is still hot aggregates of caramel will get too hot and burn in the paper bag
  - if the caramel is split you can try adding a splash of water and heating again in the microwave to improve the texture
